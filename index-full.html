    <p id='summary' class='pullquote'>
        Powderhouse Studios is a small, new high school opening next year in Somerville. It will look and feel more like a research lab or design studio than a school. We are building a team and a community devoted to inventing the future of learning, and we are looking for people who see things differently—both staff and families—to join us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is to support young people in their transition from students to independent investigators. To us, "independent investigation" just means looking to the world for inspiration, turning those inspirations into projects, and making those projects real. Whether making a skateboard or publishing a poetry magazine or programming a simulation, our role will be like the producer of a film: to wrangle the ingredients needed to help young people realize those projects with richness and rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning requires <em>doing</em>. Doing real work is hard, even when it's playful. So, supporting young people in learning to brainstorm, design, and execute projects which matter to them is what we do. We rely on computation and storytelling as two toolsets which help us open up traditionally academic subjects to hands-on approaches and to tackle many ideas school doesn't touch. This means connecting a lot of unusual subjects…from algebra and computational art to ethnography and street photography.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this is made possible by a tightly-knit, cross-functional team of staff providing individualized support to mixed age groups of young people as they grow from working in structured, interdisciplinary seminars to developing larger projects of their own design.

    <h1>Work with us</h1>
    <p>
        We can't do this without the right people. We need help finding them. You don't necessarily need a background in education to join. If you care about ideas and doing great work with young people, <a href='us@powderhouse.org'>get in touch</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or, if you know someone who might be a good fit for our team, please <a href='TK'>refer them to us</a>. Finding great people matters to us so much that we've put together an unusual referral program to help you help us.

        We are looking for 40 families to join us in our first year. If you live in Somerville, are between 11–14 years old, and school makes you feel like a round peg in a square hole, then <a href='/enroll'>register to enroll</a>. If you'd like to meet our team and find out whether PHS might be a good fit for you, email <a class='verbatim' href='mailto:us@powderhouse.org'>us@powderhouse.org</a> or text us at <a class='verbatim' href='tel:+16172846004'>617-284-6004</a> and we'll find a time to meet.

<section id='partner-with-us'>
    <h1>Partner with us</h1>
    <p>
        We're fortunate to be partnering with some extraordinary people already, ranging from the <a href='https://media.mit.edu'>MIT Media Lab</a> to the <a href='https://recurse.com'>Recurse Center</a>. TKTKTK
    </p>
    <p>
        We work with partners and volunteers in three ways:
        <ul>
            <li>As advisors who help to critique projects and inform the design of our programs</li>
            <li>As mentors who help young people manage projects and get a handle on their long term interests and ambitions.</li>
            <li>And as internship sites interested in exploring how young people at PHS and graduating from PHS can work with them in full time positions, one-off projects, or ongoing internships.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Partnerships call for a lot of our time and energy, time that—for us—could otherwise be going to young people. We know schools and young people can be hard to work with; we're committed to being an exception. We are only interested in partnerships which will actually be mutually beneficial, and are eager to invest the time and resources to make them so. With all that in mind, if you'd like to talk with us about partnering or volunteering, please drop us a line.

    <h1>Stay in touch</h1>
    <p>
        Over the past four years, we've worked with hundreds of families, educators, and world-class school-designers to build a design from scratch under Massachusetts's unique Innovation Schools legislation.
