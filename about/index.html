  We believe the future of learning should look more like the future of work than the future of school.
</p>
<p>
  We believe we grow best when we're learning.  We believe we learn best when we're creating.  And we believe we create best when we're creating something which matters to us.  We believe these things are true, regardless of how old you are.  Whether you're seventeen or seventy, the ways we learn and grow are more similar than different.
</p>
<p>
  Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to look at the most effective, creative workplaces, studios, and labs and build such a place with youth here in Somerville.  Our work is grounded in two, basic activities: telling stories and building things with computers.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission is to restore power, dignity, and play to youth.  We believe that to do that, youth can't be students, they can't be largely passive recipients of information.  They have to learn to identify problems and questions they care about and pursue them.
</p>
<p>
  This is why at Powderhouse Studios, people mostly do projects.  When people first enroll, these projects come from their involvement in staff's ongoing work and the seminars staff put together around this work.  As youth get older, they spend more and more time articulating and developing projects of their own design.  By the time a young person leaves Powderhouse Studios, they'll be comfortable tackling year-long, 1,000 hour projects.  But to do that, at some point they must do a 500 hour project…and a 100 hour project…and so on, all the way down to whatever timescale they can manage when we first meet them.
</p>
<p>
  Doing this well means we must support deep—and deeply individualized—work by young people.  To do this, we've gotten rid of traditional, subject-based classes and teaching positions.  Instead, the day is organized in three chunks—morning, lunch, and afternoon, 10AM to 5PM each day.  Staff work in tightly knit, cross-functional teams which stick together, managing mixed age cohorts of about thirty young people for years at a time.  And that's just the start of what we've changed.
</p>
<p>
  Doing all this within a public school district has been pretty hard.  All along the way, people have told us we're crazy.  And what we're describing might sound crazy.  But it's how creative work has been done for centuries—from apprenticeships to MFA programs to kindergarten classrooms.
</p>
<p>
  Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to build on these traditions, making the road by walking it, bushwhacking trails as we work to invent a future of learning where doing new things isn't so hard.
