    We believe the future of learning should look more like the future of creative work than the future of school.
</p>
<p>
    We grow best when we're learning. We learn best when we're creating. And we create best when we're creating something which matters to us. We believe these things are true, regardless of how old you are. Whether you're seventeen or seventy, the ways we learn and grow are more similar than different.

    Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to look at the most effective, creative workplaces, studios, and labs and build such a place with youth here in Somerville.
</p>
<p>
    Just as those workplaces and studios have their own tools—whether that's clay in a sculpting studio or spreadsheets in an accounting firm—our work is grounded in two, basic activities: telling stories and building things with computers.

    At Powderhouse Studios, people mostly do projects. When people first enroll, these projects come from their involvement in staff's ongoing work and the seminars staff put together around this work. As youth get older, they spend more and more time developing projects of their own design. By the time someone leaves Powderhouse Studios, they'll be comfortable tackling year-long, 1,000 hour projects. But to do that, at some point they must do a 500 hour project…and a 100 hour project…and so on, all the way down to whatever timescale they can manage when we first meet them.

    Doing this well means we must support deep—and deeply individualized—work. To do this, we've gotten rid of traditional, subject-based classes and teaching positions. Instead, the day is organized in three chunks—morning, lunch, and afternoon, 10AM to 5PM each day. Staff work in tightly knit, cross-functional teams which stick together, managing mixed age cohorts of about three dozen youth for their 4+ years at Powderhouse. And that's just the start of what we've changed.

<p>
    All along the way, people have told us it's impossible.  But it's how creative work has been done for centuries—from apprenticeships to MFA programs to kindergarten classrooms.
</p>
<p>
    Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to build on these traditions, making the road by walking it.
