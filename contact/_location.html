    We don't quite have a home yet. sprout &amp; co's current offices are just outside Davis Square in Somerville, at 339R Summer Street, Somerville, MA 02144.

    Our campus will be at <a href='https://www.markacommunities.com/powderhouse' class='link dim blue'>the Powder House Community School re-development</a>, head up by MarKa. But that won't be done 'til fall of 2018.
