    so far. We're going to spend the next year training and working together as
    part of an intensive on-boarding process.

<p class="list-intro">
    We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in building a creative
    community with youth, and if you:
</p>
<ul class="pl4-ns">
    <li>really enjoy spending time with teens.</li>
    <li>
        can do something teens might be interested in— that could be a craft
        like sculpting or a practice like computer programming or something else
        entirely.
    </li>
    <li>
        are excited about pursuing your own projects and investigations
        alongside youth…
    </li>
    <li>
        but are pumped about learning new things (outside your comfort zone) all
        the time…
    </li>
    <li>and bring joy and playfulness to your work.</li>
    <li>
        all while taking pride in your ability to work and play well on a
        diverse team.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Powderhouse Studios will be organized into small cohorts of 30–40 people.
    Those 30–40 youth will be managed by a team of five, what we call a Core
    Team. Each member of a Core Team is responsible for four things:
</p>
<ol class="pl4-ns pl3">
    <li>
        Do great projects. That could involve anything from recording an album
        to making an app.
    </li>
    <li>Help youth join you in great projects and develop their own.</li>
    <li>
        Document these projects and tell their stories and the growth that
        happens through them.
    </li>
    <li>
        And mentor youth through their adolescence, into whatever the next
        chapter holds for them.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Without traditional subjects or classes, defining which projects and
    programs happen will be up to each Core Team. Every staff member is expected
    to develop what we're calling their
    <a
        href="/work/innovation-school/archive/faq/#what-is-this-program-of-study-you-keep-talking-about-staff-developing"
        class="link dim blue"
        >program of study</a
    >: a line of inquiry or problem or question which will generate the projects
    and programs to which you'll invite your colleagues and youth.
</p>
<p>
    But a group of people doing great projects isn't quite enough. Working with
    youth brings other responsibilities to the table. Right now, we're thinking
    that it makes sense to structure these responsibilites on a team into three
    areas: program design, project management, and cohort counseling, supported
    by two domain specialists focused on computation and storytelling. The rest
    of this page attempts to outline these areas of responsibility.

  <p>
    Your job is to (1) make sure that programs run smoothly and (2) make sure
    people's projects are deep.
</p>
<p>
    Designing great programs and projects is hard. As a program designer, it's
    your responsibility to make sure that the seminars and programs staff and
    youth undertake are well-designed. That means they're coherent, they work
    smoothly, they really engage deep ideas, and they support divergent,
    individualized work.
</p>
<p>
    This doesn't mean you design everyone's programs or projects though. It
    means you're responsible for making sure programs and projects are
    well-designed.

    <li>
        …really like and have taste in big ideas; there are some you think are

  <h2 class='f-subheadline-ns f2 lh-title mb0'>📋 Project manager</h2>
  
  <p>Your job is to make sure people's projects happen.</p>
<p>
    Managing projects (much less yourself, your time, and the money and other
    resources that go into a project) is hard.
</p>
<p>
    As project manager, it's your responsibility to make sure projects are
    designed, scoped, executed, and documented well. That means putting in place
    systems to help people scope and budget them, and developing your team and

    People are complex. Whether it's food insecurity at home, a beef with their

    need to feel safe, supported, and connected to undertake hard intellectual
    journeys.

    As a domain specialist, you'll focus either on computation (building things

    storytelling. Unlike the other members of Core Teams, you won't generally be
    designing full cohort programs.
</p>
<p>
    Your job is to design tools, materials, and experiences which make sure (1)
    everyone is fluent in your domain, and (2) the programs and projects people
    undertake are consistently grounded in the powerful ideas of that domain.

  <h2 class='f-subheadline-ns f2 lh-title mb0'>⚡ Special education</h2>
  
  <p>
    We're looking for someone with a background in special education to help us redesign the special education experience for families and professional development offerings for staff from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
    We expect about a quarter of our youth to have an IEP or 504 of some sort when they enroll. We know the flexibility of our design's staffing and schedule and our access to the full offerings of district support offer a unique opportunity to redesign what's often a painful and alienating experience for families.
</p>
<p>
    We believe there's a beautiful kernel to special education: the idea of totally individualized support. And we're looking for someone to help us think that through from the ground up, much as we've tackled the rest of Powderhouse Studios' design.

  <h2 class='f-subheadline-ns f2 lh-title mb0'>🇧🇷 English as a second language</h2>
  
  <p>
    We're looking for someone with a background in working with English language learners (ELLs) to help us redesign the ELL experience for families and professional development offerings for staff from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
    We expect a bit over half of our youth to speak a language other than English.  We know the flexibility of our design's staffing and schedule and our access to the full offerings of district support offer a unique opportunity to redesign what's often a painful and alienating experience for families.
</p>
<p>
    But taking advantage of this flexibility (much less helping us to deeply incorporate ELL considerations into a project-based environment like ours) means we're looking for someone to help us think that through from the ground up, much as we've tackled the rest of Powderhouse Studios' design.
