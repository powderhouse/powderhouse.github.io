                Nope! Same proposal, different name. We decided that we didn’t
                like the “STEAM” buzzword and that we thought it’d be stale in a
                few years. We also don’t really like the kitchen-sink approach
                to curriculum design, and we were having trouble communicating
                to people that we weren’t a tech-focused school which paid lip

                Somerville while also doing a better job of communicating that

                Because we have a Superintendent who’s started a small,

                PHS succeed. Because we have an entrepreneurial Mayor who’s
                supported us from day one. Because Somerville’s awash in
                incredible opportunities for partnership with institutions like
                MIT and Tufts and Harvard—not to mention the countless
                businesses, artists, and professionals in the area. Because we
                think that Somerville’s one of just a handful of places in the
                country you could go to really think differently about what the

                The Mayor of Somerville approached sprout &amp; co in 2012 about
                the idea of opening a school under Massachusetts’s Innovation
                School legislation. Since then, we’ve worked with all sorts of
                people to put together a solid plan. The Innovation Plan
                Committee which drafted and approved the design featured union
                representatives, principals, department chairs, school committee
                members, and families. We’ve met with hundreds of school
                designers, education experts, and school leaders from across the
                country as we’ve fleshed out our design. Mary Skipper
                (Somerville's Superintendent) and many others in the district
                have helped us to flesh out all the operational details of our
                plan. We owe a lot to the dozens of people who have lent their
                time, expertise, and support over the past four years.

                their own design. Even if they happen in interdisciplinary

                Nope! We’ve worked very hard to make sure that financially, PHS
                doesn’t pull unfairly from other schools in Somerville. First,
                we went through Somerville’s end-of-year audit to figure out how
                much money is spent on what. Then, we took out the money that is
                spent across the district, regardless of enrollment (<i>e.g.</i>
                the money required for central administration). What remained
                was a lower per capita (roughly $14,000) which we designed our
                budget around. Between that and the fact that we expect some who
                might otherwise leave Somerville Public Schools—for special
                education outplacement, for charter schools, for private

                time, the standards someone hasn’t yet covered inform
                conversations staff have with young people about their projects.

                kids the same standard on the same day, one young person is
                working with three staff to develop projects that touch on those

                  Our approach rhymes with these. You can think of Powderhouse
                  Studios as a creative monastery or research institute or
                  sandbox. Except unlike all of those analogies, we're embedded
                  in the world, in a real community in Somerville. And most of
                  the people enrolling in Powderhouse Studios will do so because
                  something wasn't working for them about school.
