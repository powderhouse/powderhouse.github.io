          <section id="overview" class="bb b--light-gray">
            <p>
              We believe the future of learning should look more like the future
              of creative work than the future of school.
            </p>
            <p>
              We grow best when we're learning. We learn best when we're
              creating. And we create best when we're creating something which
              matters to us. We believe these things are true, regardless of how
              old you are. Whether you're seventeen or seventy, the ways we
              learn and grow are more similar than different.
            </p>
            <p>
              Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to look at the most effective,
              creative workplaces, studios, and labs and build such a place with
              youth here in Somerville.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as those workplaces and studios have their own tools‚Äîwhether
              that's clay in a sculpting studio or spreadsheets in an accounting
              firm‚Äîour work is grounded in two, basic activities: telling
              stories and building things with computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Powderhouse Studios, people mostly do projects. When people
              first enroll, these projects come from their involvement in
              staff's ongoing work and the seminars staff put together around
              this work. As youth get older, they spend more and more time
              developing projects of their own design. By the time someone
              leaves Powderhouse Studios, they'll be comfortable tackling
              year-long, 1,000 hour projects. But to do that, at some point they
              must do a 500 hour project‚Ä¶and a 100 hour project‚Ä¶and so on, all
              the way down to whatever timescale they can manage when we first
              meet them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing this well means we must support deep‚Äîand deeply
              individualized‚Äîwork. To do this, we've gotten rid of traditional,
              subject-based classes and teaching positions. Instead, the day is
              organized in three chunks‚Äîmorning, lunch, and afternoon, 10AM to
              5PM each day. Staff work in tightly knit, cross-functional teams
              which stick together, managing mixed age cohorts of about three
              dozen youth for their 4+ years at Powderhouse. And that's just the
              start of what we've changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              All along the way, people have told us it's impossible. But it's
              how creative work has been done for centuries‚Äîfrom apprenticeships
              to MFA programs to kindergarten classrooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to build on these traditions,
              making the road by walking it.
            </p>

          <section id="design" class="bb b--light-gray">
            <h2 class="f-subheadline-ns f2 lh-title mb0">üìè Design</h2>

            <p>
              Powderhouse Studios is for people who might benefit from (1)
              working in a smaller, more intimate community than a traditional
              high school, or (2) spending a lot more time developing deep,
              hands-on projects of their own design.
            </p>
            <p>A lot of Powderhouse's design grows out of these two focuses.</p>
            <p>
              Of course, there are many other things a school does‚Äîeverything
              from supporting college admissions and sports to the IEP process
              and English language learning. And we spent four years working
              with Somerville Public Schools to develop a design which does all
              that within the district.

                summarizes the design from that time. Most of the core design
                has remained the same, but many of the details of its
                implementation have been fleshed out since then.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The basic ideas behind Powderhouse Studios is pretty simple.</p>
            <p>
              People are organized into mixed age groups. These groups are much
              smaller than a typical high school class: about three dozen
              people. We're starting by enrolling people between 13‚Äì15.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each group has four staff who work with them‚Äîa
              <a
                href="/work/innovation-school/archive/jobs#project-manager"
                class="link dim blue"
                >project manager</a
              >,
              <a
                href="/work/innovation-school/archive/jobs#program-designer"
                class="link dim blue"
                >program designer</a
              >,
              <a
                href="/work/innovation-school/archive/jobs#youth-advocate"
                class="link dim blue"
                >youth advocate</a
              >, and
              <a
                href="/work/innovation-school/archive/jobs#domain-specialist"
                class="link dim blue"
                >domain specialist</a
              >. These groups‚Äîwhich we call "cohorts"‚Äîstick together for their
              time at Powderhouse, so they're very small and supportive. Staff
              have a lot of time to develop deep, long-term relationships with
              people.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is important because staff are going to help people develop
              their own projects. They do this by knowing people well and
              mentoring them, but also by working on their own projects and
              programs (which they involve young people in). Staff do this by
              running seminars‚Äîwhich are the closest thing we have to classes.
              Those seminars might involve anything from computational art to
              writing a screenplay or building a robot.
            </p>
            <div class="section-divider tc f1-ns f3">¬ß</div>
            <p>
              So at Powderhouse, people spend most of their time working on
              projects. When people first enroll, most of those projects might
              come from the seminars staff run. Over time, youth will get better
              at coming up with their own projects. And, youth will get better
              at working on bigger and bigger projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              As people work on projects, staff work with them to document,
              reflect upon, and critique their projects and what they're
              learning through them. People will do this in different
              ways‚Äîsometimes through essays or presentations, other times
              through videos or discussions.
            </p>
            <p>
              But one type of documentation which staff will work with youth to
              put together for all projects is what we call our "retrospective
              mapping." This mapping is just a record of the ways that the
              projects people do connect to goals youth develop with staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those goals not only include traditional academic standards (like
              <a
                href="http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/"
                class="link dim blue"
                >Common Core</a
              >
              <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" class="link dim blue"
                >Math</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/"
                class="link dim blue"
                >English Language</a
              >), but personal and professional priorities like career
              interests, college ambitions, and so on. These goals define
              people's progress toward graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taken together, this documentation gives us the information we
              need to help people define projects which will ensure youth are
              learning what they need to be successful after their time at
              Powderhouse. This also gives us what we need to do things like
              generate portfolios and traditional transcripts when someone is
              looking to transfer or apply to college.
            </p>
            <div class="section-divider tc f1-ns f3">¬ß</div>
            <p>
              Even though doing projects sounds simple, they take a lot of time.
              You can't really work on projects in forty or eighty minute chunks
              like most classes. You need lots of large blocks of time. And if
              people are working on projects that are <em>different</em> from
              one another's, it's even harder. That's why our schedule looks so
              different.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're open 10AM‚Äì5PM for youth, and 8AM‚Äì5PM for staff (with morning
              supervision and breakfast programming for those who want it).
              We're open 220 days a year. There's no homework. Instead of having
              normal class periods, there are really just three chunks to the
              day: morning, lunch, and afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally, mornings will be when the seminars staff run will
              happen. Afternoons will be about people working on the projects
              they started in the morning. As people get older, they'll manage
              more and more of their time. That may start with them just working
              on their own projects in the morning. But eventually, it may lead
              to their enrolling in classes off campus or working at internships
              in the community which we work with them to secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing this alongside the other things school does is more
              complicated than you'd think. Sports? Special education? Music?
              Language? There's no one answer to all of these questions. You can
              find a lot of the answers in
              <a
                href="/work/innovation-school/archive/faq"
                class="link dim blue"
                >our FAQ</a
              >
              and
              <a href="#additional-design-resources" class="link dim blue"
                >design resources</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              But overall, something which ties together a lot of our answers is
              flexibility and individualized support. For example, even though
              we don't have traditional music or language classes, we have a
              stipend system for youth and a collection of community partners
              (ranging from Harvard and MIT to the Boston Language Institute)
              with whom we'll be working to offer individualized classes and
              support to people. This is only possible because Powderhouse
              Studios is designed to let staff support every young person
              individually.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making all these pieces fit together has taken a lot of time and
              support from Somerville Public Schools, Massachusetts' Department
              of Elementary and Secondary Education, and dozens of families,
              community organizations, school designers, and experts from around
              the country.

              PHS is a product of
              <a href="https://thesprouts.org" class="link blue dim"
                >sprout &amp; co</a
              >‚Äôs work over the past five years. We wouldn't be here without the
              support of hundreds of families, Somerville Public School staff,
              and experts from around the nation. They've helped us put together
              a world-class, in-district design using
              <a
                href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/choicead.html"
                class="link blue dim"
                >Massachusetts‚Äô Innovation Schools legislation</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009, we began designing and running in- and afterschool
              programs with youth and evening programs with adults, working with
              partners ranging from the Cloud Foundation to Google to the
              Harvard Extension School. Historically, our programs have focused
              on making scientific investigation more of a cultural activity,
              something meaningful to people‚Äôs everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012, Mayor Curtatone approached us about opening a new high
              school in Somerville under Massachusetts‚Äôs Innovation Schools
              Initiative, a piece of legislation which allows schools to have
              some of the same autonomies and flexibilities granted to Charter
              Schools while keeping money and oversight within the District.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2013, our initial prospectus was unanimously approved by the
              Superintendent, chair of the School Committee, and president of
              the teachers‚Äô union. This allowed us to convene an Innovation
              Planning Committee including parents, teachers, administrators,
              and other Somerville community members. They spent nearly a year
              reviewing and ultimately approving our Innovation Plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014, we were the first to seek (much less receive) relief from
              state statutes and regulations around school design under the
              Innovation Schools legislation. The Department of Elementary and
              Secondary Education granted us relief from those regulations
              governing procurement and educator licensure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beginning in late 2016, we joined the 7th and 8th grade team at
              the Healey School, developing
              <a
                href="https://thesprouts.github.io/healey"
                class="link dim blue"
                >interdisciplinary, project-based programs</a
              >
              we hope will serve as a springboard for continued work at the
              Healey and our own enrollment outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope to bring our final plan before the Somerville School
              Committee in fall 2018‚Äîafter we wrap up our negotiations with the
              Somerville Teachers Association‚Äîand open in Fall 2019 as our
              campus renovation is completed. (We‚Äôll be located at the older
              Powder House Community School building, which is being renovated
              over the next year into a fascinating, community campus with PHS
              at its center.)
