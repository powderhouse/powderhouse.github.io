    There are <a href="/about#team" class='link dim blue'>four of us</a> right now. We're looking to build a founding team. We're going to spend the next year training and working together as part of an intensive on-boarding process. But there are a few things we can't develop in you, a few things we have to hire for:
</p>
<ul class='pl4-ns pl3'>
    <li>You actually like spending time with adolescents.</li>
    <li>You can do something they might be interested in. That could be a craft or practice—like sculpting or computer programming—or something else entirely.</li>
    <li>You are pumped about the chance to learn and deeply explore new ideas (not just within your background) all the time. (This is another way of saying you should be comfortable not knowing things.)</li>
    <li>You bring joy and playfulness to your work.</li>
    <li>You take pride in your ability to work and play well on a team.</li>
    <li>You are excited about developing and pursuing your own projects and investigations alongside youth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are important to us because we're building a creative community. And that means you need to create, with and alongside youth.
