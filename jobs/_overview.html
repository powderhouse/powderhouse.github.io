    When someone really starts to <em>get</em> what we're talking about with Powderhouse Studios, they almost always say one of two things:
</p>
<ol class='pl4-ns pl3'>
    <li>Wow, your district is really behind you in doing this?</li>
    <li>Where are you going to find these incredible people to build this with you?</li>
</ol>
<p>
    We need your help with (2). <a href='/TK' class='rum-serif link blue dim'>ðŸŽˆ Apply now</a>. Even if you can't join us right now (or even this year). We're always hiring.
</p>
<p class='list-intro'>
    There are <a href="/about#team" class='link dim blue'>four of us</a> right now. We're looking to build a founding team. We're going to spend the next year training and working together as part of an intensive on-boarding process. But there are a few things we can't develop in you, a few things we have to hire for:
</p>
<ul class='pl4-ns pl3'>
    <li>You actually like spending time with adolescents.</li>
    <li>You can do something they might be interested in. That could be a craft or practiceâ€”like sculpting or computer programmingâ€”or something else entirely.</li>
    <li>You are pumped about the chance to learn and deeply explore new ideas (not just within your background) all the time. (This is another way of saying you should be comfortable not knowing things.)</li>
    <li>You bring joy and playfulness to your work.</li>
    <li>You take pride in your ability to work and play well on a team.</li>
    <li>You are excited about developing and pursuing your own projects and investigations alongside youth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are important to us because we're building a creative community. And that means you need to create, with and alongside youth.
