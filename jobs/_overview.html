    We're building our founding team now. We're going to spend the next year training and working together as part of an intensive on-boarding process.

    We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in building a creative community with youth, and if you:
</p>
<ul class='pl4-ns'>
    <li>really enjoy spending time with teens.</li>
    <li>can do something teens might be interested inâ€” that could be a craft like sculpting or a practice like computer programming or something else entirely.</li>
    <li>are excited about pursuing your own projects and investigations alongside youthâ€¦</li>
    <li>but are pumped about learning new things (outside your comfort zone) all the timeâ€¦</li>
    <li>and bring joy and playfulness to your work.</li>
    <li>all while taking pride in your ability to work and play well on a diverse team.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Powderhouse Studios will be organized into small cohorts of 30â€“40 people. Those 30â€“40 youth will be managed by a team of five, what we call a Core Team. Each member of a Core Team is responsible for four things:
</p>
<ol class='pl4-ns pl3'>
    <li>Do great projects. That could involve anything from recording an album to making an app.</li>
    <li>Help youth join you in great projects and develop their own.</li>
    <li>Document these projects and tell their stories and the growth that happens through them.</li>
    <li>And mentor youth through their adolescence, into whatever the next chapter holds for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Without traditional subjects or classes, defining which projects and programs happen will be up to each Core Team. Every staff member is expected to develop what we're calling their <a href='/faq/#what-is-this-program-of-study-you-keep-talking-about-staff-developing' class='link dim blue'>program of study</a>: a line of inquiry or problem or question which will generate the projects and programs to which you'll invite your colleagues and youth.
</p>
<p>
    But a group of people doing great projects isn't quite enough. Working with youth brings other responsibilities to the table. Right now, we're thinking that it makes sense to structure these responsibilites on a team into three areas: program design, project management, and cohort counseling, supported by two domain specialists focused on computation and storytelling.  The rest of this page attempts to outline these areas of responsibility.
