    Powderhouse Studios is organized into small cohorts of 30–40 people. Those 30–40 youth are managed by a team of five, what we call a Core Team. We're looking to hire that first team. You'll work with four other people in a tightly integrated, cross-functional team.
</p>
<p class='list-intro'>
    On this team, your work is fourfold:
</p>
<ol class='pl4-ns pl3'>
    <li>Do great projects. That could be anything from record an album to make an app.</li>
    <li>Help youth join you in great projects (and develop their own).</li>
    <li>Document and tell the stories of these projects (and the growth that happens through them).</li>
    <li>And mentor youth through their adolescence, into whatever the next chapter holds for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each Core Team works together to make this happen. Every staff member is expected to develop what we're calling their program of study.
</p>
<p>
    A <a href='/faq#TK' class='link dim blue'>program of study</a> is nothing more than a line of inquiry— a perspective or problem or question which will generate the projects and programs to which you'll invite your colleagues and cohort.
</p>
<p>
    But a group of people doing great projects isn't quite enough. Working with youth brings other responsibilities to the table. Right now, we're thinking that it makes sense to structure these responsibilites on a team into three areas: program design, project management, and cohort counseling, supported by two domain specialists focused on computation and storytelling.
