    People are complex. Whether it's food insecurity at home, a beef with their girlfriend, social cliques, or tension with their team, healthy people have a lot going right for them. We believe that if people don't feel safe, supported, and connected, the hard intellectual journeys we hope they undertake at Powderhouse Studios are nigh impossible.
