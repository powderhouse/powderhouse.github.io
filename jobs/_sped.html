    We're looking for someone with a background in special education to help us redesign the special education experience for families and professional development offerings for staff from the ground up.

    We expect about a quarter of our youth to have an IEP or 504 of some sort when they enroll. We know the flexibility of our design's staffing and schedule and our access to the full offerings of district support offer a unique opportunity to redesign what's often a painful and alienating experience for families.

    We believe there's a beautiful kernel to special education: the idea of totally individualized support. And we're looking for someone to help us think that through from the ground up, much as we've tackled the rest of Powderhouse Studios' design.
