    Your job is to make sure people's projects happen.
</p>
<p>
    Managing projects (much less yourself, your time, and the money and other resources that go into a project) is hard.
</p>
<p>
    As project manager, it's your responsibility to make sure projects are designed, scoped, executed, and documented well. That means putting in place systems to help people scope and budget them, and developing your team and cohort's capacity to do so.
