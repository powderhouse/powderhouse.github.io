    Your job is to (1) make sure that programs run smoothly and (2) make sure people's projects are deep.
</p>

    Designing great programs and projects is hard. As a program designer, it's your responsibility to make sure that the seminars and programs staff and youth undertake are well-designed. That means they're coherent, they work smoothly, they really engage deep ideas, and they support divergent, individualized work.

    This doesn't mean you design everyone's programs or projects though. It means you're responsible for making sure programs and projects are well-designed.

    You'll be:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…developing your team's and cohort's capacity to design by finding and developing great resources and mentoring teammates.</li>
    <li>…curating textbooks, topics, and inspirations for programs and individuals’ projects</li>
    <li>…working with staff to deepen and enrich their own intellectual interests and background.</li>
    <li>…and of course, developing your <a href="/faq#TK" class='link dim blue'>program of study</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class='list-intro'>
    This probably means you:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…are pretty voracious, easily interested in everything and happy to dive into something you don't know much about.</li>
    <li>…know how to think through an audience's experience— maybe you've taught before, or planned events, or designed a product.</li>
    <li>…really like and have a taste in big ideas; there are some you think are powerful and others you think are useless and others you think are beautiful.</li>
</ul>
