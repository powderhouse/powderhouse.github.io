    Your job is to (1) make sure that programs run smoothly and (2) make sure people's projects are deep.
</p>
<p>
    Designing great programs and projects is hard. As a program designer, it's your responsibility to make sure that the seminars and programs staff and youth undertake are well-designed. That means they're coherent, they work smoothly, they really engage deep ideas, and they support divergent, individualized work.

    This doesn't mean you design everyone's programs or projects though. It means you're responsible for making sure programs and projects are well-designed.

    <li>â€¦really like and have taste in big ideas; there are some you think are powerful and others you think are useless and others you think are beautiful.</li>
