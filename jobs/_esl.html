    We're looking for someone with a background in working with English language learners (ELLs) to help us redesign the ELL experience for families and professional development offerings for staff from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
    We expect a bit over half of our youth to speak a language other than English.  We know the flexibility of our design's staffing and schedule and our access to the full offerings of district support offer a unique opportunity to redesign what's often a painful and alienating experience for families.
</p>
<p>
    But taking advantage of this flexibility (much less helping us to deeply incorporate ELL considerations into a project-based environment like ours) means we're looking for someone to help us think that through from the ground up, much as we've tackled the rest of Powderhouse Studios' design.
