    Powderhouse Studios is for people who might benefit from (1) working in a smaller, more intimate community than a traditional high school, or (2) spending a lot more time developing deep, hands-on projects of their own design.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of Powderhouse's design grows out of these two focuses.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are many other things a school does—everything from supporting college admissions and sports to the IEP process and English language learning. And we spent four years working with Somerville Public Schools to develop a design which does all that within the district.

<p>
    The basic ideas behind Powderhouse Studios is pretty simple.
</p>
<p>
    People are organized into mixed age groups. These groups are much smaller than a typical high school class: about three dozen people. We're starting by enrolling people between 13–15.
</p>
<p>
    Each group has four staff who work with them—a <a href="/jobs#project-manager" class="link dim blue">project manager</a>, <a href="/jobs#program-designer" class="link dim blue">program designer</a>, <a href="/jobs#youth-advocate" class="link dim blue">youth advocate</a>, and <a href="/jobs#domain-specialist" class="link dim blue">domain specialist</a>. These groups—which we call "cohorts"—stick together for their time at Powderhouse, so they're very small and supportive. Staff have a lot of time to develop deep, long-term relationships with people.
</p>
<p>
    This is important because staff are going to help people develop their own projects. They do this by knowing people well and mentoring them, but also by working on their own projects and programs (which they involve young people in). Staff do this by running seminars—which are the closest thing we have to classes. Those seminars might involve anything from computational art to writing a screenplay or building a robot.
</p>
<div class='section-divider tc f1-ns f3'>§</div>
<p>
    So at Powderhouse, people spend most of their time working on projects. When people first enroll, most of those projects might come from the seminars staff run. Over time, youth will get better at coming up with their own projects. And, youth will get better at working on bigger and bigger projects.
</p>
<p>
    As people work on projects, staff work with them to document, reflect upon, and critique their projects and what they're learning through them. People will do this in different ways—sometimes through essays or presentations, other times through videos or discussions.
</p>
<p>
    But one type of documentation which staff will work with youth to put together for all projects is what we call our "retrospective mapping." This mapping is just a record of the ways that the projects people do connect to goals youth develop with staff.
</p>
<p>
    Those goals not only include traditional academic standards (like <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/" class="link dim blue">Common Core</a> <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/" class="link dim blue">Math</a> and <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/" class="link dim blue">English Language</a>), but personal and professional priorities like career interests, college ambitions, and so on. These goals define people's progress toward graduation.
</p>
<p>
    Taken together, this documentation gives us the information we need to help people define projects which will ensure youth are learning what they need to be successful after their time at Powderhouse. This also gives us what we need to do things like generate portfolios and traditional transcripts when someone is looking to transfer or apply to college.
</p>
<div class='section-divider tc f1-ns f3'>§</div>
<p>
    Even though doing projects sounds simple, they take a lot of time. You can't really work on projects in forty or eighty minute chunks like most classes. You need lots of large blocks of time. And if people are working on projects that are <em>different</em> from one another's, it's even harder. That's why our schedule looks so different.
</p>
<p>
    We're open 10AM–5PM for youth, and 8AM–5PM for staff (with morning supervision and breakfast programming for those who want it). We're open 220 days a year. There's no homework. Instead of having normal class periods, there are really just three chunks to the day: morning, lunch, and afternoon.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, mornings will be when the seminars staff run will happen. Afternoons will be about people working on the projects they started in the morning. As people get older, they'll manage more and more of their time. That may start with them just working on their own projects in the morning. But eventually, it may lead to their enrolling in classes off campus or working at internships in the community which we work with them to secure.
</p>
<p>
    Doing this alongside the other things school does is more complicated than you'd think. Sports? Special education? Music? Language? There's no one answer to all of these questions. You can find a lot of the answers in <a href="/faq" class="link dim blue">our FAQ</a> and <a href="#additional-design-resources" class="link dim blue">design resources</a>.
</p>
<p>
    But overall, something which ties together a lot of our answers is flexibility and individualized support. For example, even though we don't have traditional music or language classes, we have a stipend system for youth and a collection of community partners (ranging from Harvard and MIT to the Boston Language Institute) with whom we'll be working to offer individualized classes and support to people. This is only possible because Powderhouse Studios is designed to let staff support every young person individually.
</p>
<p>
    Making all these pieces fit together has taken a lot of time and support from Somerville Public Schools, Massachusetts' Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and dozens of families, community organizations, school designers, and experts from around the country.
