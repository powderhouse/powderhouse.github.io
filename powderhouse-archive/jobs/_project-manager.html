    Your job is to make sure people's projects happen.
</p>
<p>
    Managing projects (much less yourself, your time, and the money and other resources that go into a project) is hard.
</p>
<p>
    As project manager, it's your responsibility to make sure projects are designed, scoped, executed, and documented well. That means putting in place systems to help people scope and budget them, and developing your team and cohort's capacity to do so.

    You'll be:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…designing project management systems and workflows to help youth articulate, specify, scope, and manage projects</li>
    <li>…growing the capacity of youth to manage projects from one­ and two ­day projects up to 1,000­-hour, year-long projects</li>
    <li>…managing the documentation of your colleagues' and cohort's work</li>
    <li>…developing the resources and experiences your team and cohort need to become good project managers</li>
    <li>…and of course, developing your <a href="/faq/#what-is-this-program-of-study-you-keep-talking-about-staff-developing" class='link dim blue'>program of study</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class='list-intro'>
    This probably means you:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…get a kick out of getting things done; you really appreciate what it means to finish something</li>
    <li>…have experience—or a talent for—managing people under open­-ended, ambiguous, and uncertain conditions</li>
    <li>…know how to reduce scope to hit a deadline or budget</li>
    <li>…have experience with the design process—surfacing requirements, articulating dimensions of performance, defining and measuring (both qualitative and quantitative) results, <span class='i'>etc.</span></li>
</ul>
