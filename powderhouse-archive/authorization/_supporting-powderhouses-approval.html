	<p>
		Hey there!
	</p>

	<p>
		We’ve got some exciting news about <a class='link dim red' href='https://powderhouse.org'>Powderhouse Studios</a>, and we wanted to tell you about it…and we hope you’ll get involved!
	</p>

	<p>
		In January 2019, the Somerville Teachers’ Association <a class='link dim red' href='http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/district-leadership/somerville-school-committee/powderhouse-studios-proposal'>approved</a> Powderhouse Studios’ union contract, and we’ve finally moved into the last phase of the approval process, including public comment and deliberation leading to a School Committee vote on March 4th.
	</p>
	<p>
		Until then, the Powderhouse team and Somerville School Committee want to hear from all corners of the Somerville community. So far, there hasn’t been much of a way to formally express support and move the proposal forward, but now is the time your voice can really count.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you’d like to see Powderhouse Studios happen in Somerville (and/or learn more about its design), there are three things you can do:
	</p>
	<ol type="1">
	    <li>
	        <p>
	        	Attend a public hearing or another School Committee meeting and sign up to make a public comment in support of the school (scroll down a bit for dates <a class='link dim red' href='http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/district-leadership/somerville-school-committee/powderhouse-studios-proposal'>here</a>).
	        </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        <p>
	        	Share your support with School Committee members directly by <a class='link dim red' href='https://www.notion.so/powderhouse/Somerville-School-Committee-Contact-Info-January-2019-35cf1f70b03c4d00b14954560ce74d53'>phone or email</a> or by attending their <a class='link dim red' href='http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/sites/default/files/SC%20Office%20Hours%20Winter%202019_UPDATED011418.pdf'>office hours</a> in person.
