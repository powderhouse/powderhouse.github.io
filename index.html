            🎉 Powderhouse Studios is a small, new high school slated to open next year in Somerville. Inspired by the best creative workplaces, studios, and labs, it will look and feel very different from a traditional school.

            📆 Over the past four years, we've been developing Powderhouse Studios with the City of Somerville, alongside hundreds of families, educators, and world-class school-designers…all under the umbrella of <a href='http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/choicead.html' class='link phs-red hover-blue'>Massachusetts’s Innovation Schools legislation</a>.  And now, we're looking to grow our team. 👥

            If you 1⃣ like teens, 2⃣ can do something they might care about (anything from make music to program a computer), and 3⃣ want to join a founding team inventing the future of learning, then please get in touch.  (And no, you don’t necessarily need a background in education to join.)

            🔍 Or, if you know someone who might be a good fit for our team, please refer them to us. Finding great people matters to us so much that we’ve put together an unusual referral program to help you help us.
