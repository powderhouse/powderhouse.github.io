            🎉 Powderhouse Studios is a small, new high school slated to open next year in Somerville. Inspired by the best creative workplaces, studios, and labs, it will look and feel very different from a traditional school.

            📆 Over the past five years, we've been developing Powderhouse Studios with the City of Somerville, alongside hundreds of families, educators, and world-class school-designers…all under the umbrella of <a href='http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/choicead.html' class='link blue dim'>Massachusetts’s Innovation Schools legislation</a>.  And now, we're looking to grow our team.

            👥 If you like teens, can do something they might care about (anything from make music to program a computer), and want to join a founding team inventing the future of learning, then please get in touch.  (And no, you don’t necessarily have to be a teacher to join.)

        <p>
            🔍 Or, if you know someone who might be a great for our team, please refer them to us. Finding great people matters to us so much that we’ve put together a pretty unusual referral program to help you help us.

            💯 The <a href='http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/district-leadership/somerville-school-committee' class='link blue dim'>Somerville School Committee</a> will be taking their final vote on our proposal this fall.  If you want to help out with that, <a href='TK' class='link blue dim'>let us know</a>.  Until then, we can't <em>officially</em> enroll people.  But, if you'd like to get on the list for our enrollment lottery, <a href='TK' class='link blue dim'>pre-register here</a>.
