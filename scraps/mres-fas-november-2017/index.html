  <!--  # Notes from Mitch We’ll spend some time sharing experiences from the past week, then we’ll turn the session over to you (probably around 7:30pm). You can organize things in any way you’d like. The session ends by 9:00pm (but it’s also OK to end earlier). There’s a big monitor, if you want to show any videos or images. /// A few suggestions… You might want to start by showing a video about your project. And as you talk about the principles underlying your new school, you might want to try to engage the students in talking about their own school experiences, and how those experiences compare/contrast to what you’re trying to support. /// The students are first semester freshman, so none of them are doing UROPs yet. Many are hoping to UROP next seemster. The seminar is called “Designing New Technologies for Kids”, and the students pro-actively signed up for it, so they certainly have interest in “kids” and generally have some interest in education/learning. But most of them probably haven’t done much reading on issues related to education/learning. In the freshman seminar, we’ve had discussions about education/learning issues (e.g., a session about the Computer Clubhouse initiative and a session about our Learning Creative Learning course). And I gave each of the students a copy of my book. But I haven’t assigned weekly readings (or other “homework”) for the seminar, since I want to allow students to focus on their core courses, and to view the seminar as a “break” in their busy schedules. I’ve also asked my two new graduate students to join the session tomorrow. They have a much deeper interest and background in education/learning, so the group tomorrow will be some unevenness in background and interests. /// It might be best to start the session in a very straightforward way: by describing the goals and plans for Powderhouse Studios. I think the students will find the ideas interesting (and provocative), and they will have lots of questions. You can also personalize it by asking students to compare Powderhouse with their own school experience. -->
