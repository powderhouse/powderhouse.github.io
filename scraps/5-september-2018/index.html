                            Insight Prison Project was founded in 1997 with one class for 14 male prisoners at San Quentin State Prison. Today, IPP offers unique and effective programs for thousands of men, women, and youth at 15 state prisons, three county jails, several reentry facilities, and one juvenile institution. Our core program is the Victim/Offender Education Group (VOEG), which includes an 18 month curriculum that was designed by licensed mental health therapists in collaboration with survivors of violent crimes and incarcerated offenders. ​IPP provides highly trained facilitators and creates a space with VOEG that allows victims and offenders an opportunity to work together, which dramatically aids in the healing process for everyone involved, and enhances public safety by greatly reducing recidivism.  In addition to VOEG, Insight Prison Project offers a certified violence prevention class, critical thinking courses, professional crisis-intervention training, a therapeutic artistic ensemble, and pre-parole training. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We recognize the enormous impact of race and class in the justice system, and we also recognize that victims of crime are often not allowed to participate in the criminal justice process. We work towards a future in which the tools of Restorative Justice are available to victims and offenders so that we can all better address the problems of crime and violence. We hope to bridge the gap between punishment and parole through rehabilitation, allowing prisoners to break the cycle of incarceration, stay out of prison, and become productive community members. We are also dedicated to giving crime survivors a voice in this process. 
                        </p>

                    <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">We mean this in two ways:</p>
                    <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">The first is that the object of your program of study should engage powerful ideas in such a way as to lead you to see old things in new ways.  "Powerful" might sound vague, but it isn't.  If an idea is full of power, we must be able to do something with it.  "What can I do with it?" naturally brings us to consider 1) the nature of phenomena in the world, 2) our own nature, and 3) [implicitly] the nature of what we might want to do.  Specifically, this means that a powerful idea is:</p>
                    <ol style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">
                        <li><b>…fundamental</b>, i.e. it meaningfully connects to many phenomena in the world.  This is also likely to mean that a program of study is framed in terms of ideas and questions, not fields.</li>
                        <li><b>…usable</b>, i.e. its form and activities are well-matched to our nature.</li>
                        <li><b>…relevant</b>, i.e. it enables us to do things we care about.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">The second sense of depth which matters to us is the extent to which the program of study engages its object.  A program of study shouldn't treat ideas superficially; it should look at them close up, empirically and from first principles.</p>

First, if you assume a biology lens, you quickly get into the world of, "Is a virus alive?" which already kind of casts deep doubt on the idea that being living is obvious/clear (POWERFUL IDEA = Whether something is alive isn't clear.) From there, if we extend into the world of AI, thinking that we can build life starts to get into Dr. Frankenstein/God territory. If life and God aren't fundamental, what is...-->

You can read this book and shake your head, but I wanted to return to the brief conversation we had about why we decided not to do so much reading all at once. Alec always says, "You only learn from what you learn from." You have to *work* to access a powerful idea, to truly feel and apply it, to see it in its full glory. For me, at the time that I read this book, it turned me onto the fact that institutions controlled my life. That a school or a hospital or a company wasn't just a bunch of people with similar goals. Unlike gravity, I 'knew' institutions existed before reading this book, but didn't really know what they were or how they functioned. This connects to whether corporations are people; it connects to whether you should trust the actions of a company; it means that, if you are someone—like I was—who wanted to make the world a better place for *humans* that improving institutions might not be the best way to go about this, which really rules out a lot of job options.-->

                        <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">We mean this in two ways:</p>
                        <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">The first is that the object of your program of study should engage powerful ideas in such a way as to lead you to see old things in new ways.  "Powerful" might sound vague, but it isn't.  If an idea is full of power, we must be able to do something with it.  "What can I do with it?" naturally brings us to consider 1) the nature of phenomena in the world, 2) our own nature, and 3) [implicitly] the nature of what we might want to do.  Specifically, this means that a powerful idea is:</p>
                        <ol style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">
                            <li><b>…fundamental</b>, i.e. it meaningfully connects to many phenomena in the world.  This is also likely to mean that a program of study is framed in terms of ideas and questions, not fields.</li>
                            <li><b>…usable</b>, i.e. its form and activities are well-matched to our nature.</li>
                            <li><span style="color:darkorange;"><b>…relevant</b>, i.e. it enables us to do things we care about.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p style="font-size:.58em;text-align:left;">The second sense of depth which matters to us is the extent to which the program of study engages its object.  A program of study shouldn't treat ideas superficially; it should look at them close up, empirically and from first principles.</p>
