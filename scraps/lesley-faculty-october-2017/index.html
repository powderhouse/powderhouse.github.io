    <!-- The audience for our work with Lesley is initially new staff, and then new youth.  They're being brought on-board to an organization working to define a creative community, and therefore need exposure to people doing creative work, support doing creative work themselves, and time and space to reflect on how creative work works.  We want creative professionals to help us design and run some of these experiences.  This presentation is intended to help them understand who we are, what we're doing, and how we might get involved. -->

                TIME: [2m]

                We're looking for staff who will help us to co-design and co-run experiences (including collated readings, materials, and exercises) which will introduce people to (1) a fluency, (2) how to critique that fluency, (3) the process of creating work in that fluency, and (4) perhaps some perspective into the professional practice of that fluency.

                The fluencies we're currently looking at include:

                1. Drawing — So that people can capture and communicate ideas/prototypes in sketching, diagrams
                2. Animation — So that people can capture/communicate how things work in diagrams, basic animations
                3. Photography — So that people know how to take a reasonable photo and have some experience doing so expressively and with intent to create portraits of people, events, and products/products
                4. Videography — So that people have some sense of how to do video (and its audio) reasonably, for the purposes of documenting projects and interviewing people
                5. Interactive/digital — So that people have some skill in putting together rich, minimally interactive documentation/stories of projects and their work

                But wait a second, why are we looking for this?  What's the context? -->

                    TIME: 5m

                    We're starting a high school called Powderhouse Studios.  Much of how we've approached the design has started with creative, highly functional workplaces—research labs, artist's studios, and so on—and worked to figure out how to create such a place with youth, in a traditional public school district.

                    We started down this path about five years ago.  Last year, we received a big grant from the XQ institute. -->

                    You can see that for most people, they still think of this as a school which is weird in ways X and Y and Z.  That's not how we think of it, we trying to just think of it as a creative workplace, complete with the large blocks of time, teams of multidisciplinary staff, and interdisciplinary work which are the norm in those places. -->

                Unlike an art school or music school, as a public school, we can't get really good at something by specializing in content: we want to work with people with all sorts of backgrounds and interests and aptitudes.  So instead, we've specialized in the form, the tools we use.  People will be spending a lot of time building things with computers and telling stories.  We think these are two toolsets which together can connect to an unusually broad set of interests— -->

                <!-- TOPIC: The actual opportunity
                TIME: 3m

                We're here today because we think there's a great opportunity for a collaboration between Lesley and Powderhouse to design and run an immersive series of workshops which introduce people to a creative practice.  We'd love to talk with you if you might be able to help!  We _aren't_ looking for "just" a drawing (or photography or videography or whatever) workshop.  We know we can't do justice to those skills in the time we have.

                Instead, we want participants to:
                1. …get to a basic level of fluency, enough to improve on their own (meaning they're also equipped with supporting resources to go further on their own)
                2. …understand how work is critiqued in that domain
                3. …understand a bit about how the creative process looks in that domain— what does the production of a piece look like, from start to finish
                4. …hear a bit about how fluency in this domain changes how you think
                5. …get some insight into the professional world of that domain

                …all in maybe a three week, full time experience. (We have flexibility around the constraints and budget, but we just wanted to give you a sense of what we're imagining.) -->

                    We're looking for help designing and running immersive, workshop experiences exploring ✏ drawing, 🎞 animation, 📷 photography, 📹 videography, and 💻 web design which help participants:
