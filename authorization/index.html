<p>
	After nearly seven years, Powderhouse Studios is finally in the final stage of its design and approval (ðŸ¤ž) process: School Committee authorization! This page provides some information about that process, including upcoming opportunities to get involved.
</p>
<p>
	Somerville Public Schools is also maintaining a page providing information on Powderhouseâ€™s proposal and progress <a class='link dim blue' href="http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/district-leadership/somerville-school-committee/powderhouse-studios-proposal">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Between now and 4 March 2019 (when the Somerville School Committee will vote on the Powderhouse Studios proposal), the Powderhouse team and Somerville School Committee are very interested in hearing community membersâ€™ questions, concerns, and ideas.

	<p>
		Hey there!
	</p>

	<p>
		Weâ€™ve got some exciting news about <a class='link dim red' href='https://powderhouse.org'>Powderhouse Studios</a>, and we wanted to tell you about itâ€¦and we hope youâ€™ll get involved!
	</p>

	<p>
		In January 2019, the Somerville Teachersâ€™ Association <a class='link dim red' href='http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/district-leadership/somerville-school-committee/powderhouse-studios-proposal'>approved</a> Powderhouse Studiosâ€™ union contract, and weâ€™ve finally moved into the last phase of the approval process, including public comment and deliberation leading to a School Committee vote on March 4th.
	</p>
	<p>
		Until then, the Powderhouse team and Somerville School Committee want to hear from all corners of the Somerville community. So far, there hasnâ€™t been much of a way to formally express support and move the proposal forward, but now is the time your voice can really count.
	</p>
	<p>
