      // In this page, we have a password input we'd like to check, and a "secret" display we'd like to be able to show (when the right password is entered) and hide (when people exit out of the display). To be able to interact with them programatically, we need some way to refer to them. We use `document.querySelector` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll to find them, and we store a reference to them in a variable using `let` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let `querySelector` lets us use the syntax for CSS selectors to search for matching elements from JavaScript. The `document` object is the programmatic representation of the entire document the browser is currently displaying, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction
      // let form = document.querySelector("form");
      let pass_try = document.querySelector("#pass-try");
      let secret = document.querySelector("#secret");
      let nope = document.querySelector("#nope");

      // Now, with the `form` element in hand (a reference saved in a variable called `form`—but which we could have called anything), we want to make something happen when we "submit" the form: In particular, we want to check whether the password is correct, and if it is, reveal the secret.

      // To do this, we add an `eventListener`: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events which lets us run a function when a particular event happens. The browser (and you can) define "events" which it lets you monitor—things like `click` and `mousemove`. These events "fire" (i.e. are broadcast) when they happen to different elements—e.g. when something is clicked, that something broadcasts a `click` event. In our case, we have a form, and since it includes an `input` with type `submit` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit we can listen for the `submit` event.
      pass_try.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        // Then, we tell the eventListener what to do when the submit event happens with a function we write inline. That function takes information about the event (passed as the first argument, which we call "event").

        // // Normally, form submission redirects you to a new page— `preventDefault` prevents that from happening, since we don't want to send the information anywhere or go to a new page; we're just going to process it all ourselves https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault
        // event.preventDefault();

        // At this point, the `submit` event has fired, which means the `submit` button was clicked, which means we can go grab the value of the password. To do this, we look at the event, and we look at the `target`: https://dillionmegida.com/p/understanding-event-target-and-use-cases/ which is the thing that experienced the event. In our case, since the `form` element contains two `input`s (one for entering the password, and one for the "submit" button), `event.target` is a list of references to each of those— We want to get the first, so we use `event.target[0]`, since lists (often called arrays) in JavaScript refer to their entries starting at 0— so the "first" element is actually the 0th, the "second" is the 1st, and so forth: https://javascript.info/array

        // Then, we look at the `value` of that `input`—The `value` is what's actually _in_ the `input`; at this point and time it should be the password which was entered. For ease of use, we save this in another variable.
        let submittedPassword = prompt("What is the password?");
        if (submittedPassword == "snail") {
          // Then, we check if password matches the string "password" (the "right" answer), and if it does…
          console.log("🎉 The correct password was entered!"); // We print out a message to the console: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console
          secret.style.display = "block"; // And we go back to the #secret div (to which we've stored a reference in a variable called `secret`), and we use the `style` attribute to set the "inline" style of the div: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-style/ Because inline styling take precedence (in the CSS cascade: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) over the rules which we wrote in the `style` tag earlier, this sets the `display` attribute back to `block` (the default: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout), instead of `none`, which has the effect of showing the div which has been hidden
          nope.style.display = "none";
        } else {
          // If they get the password wrong, print that message to the console
          console.log("🤮 Sorry, that password is wrong…");
          nope.style.display = "block";
        }
      });

      // Finally, we want to offer the ability to "exit" our secret. We've put a div inside the #secret div, and given it an ID of `secret-exit`. Just as we grabbed references to the `form` and #secret div earlier with `querySelector`, we do the same here
      let secretExit = document.querySelector("#secret-exit");
      // So that we can add a `click` eventListener, and this time when it is clicked…
      secretExit.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        // We are going to set the #secret's inline style to `none`, hiding it
        secret.style.display = "none";
      });
