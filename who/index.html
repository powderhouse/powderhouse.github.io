        Our team grew out of sprout &amp; co's design work beginning in 2009. Over the past four years, hundreds of families, world-class school designers and policy experts, and Somerville Public School staff have helped us to create PHS's design.

        At the core of that design is a belief that small is beautiful. We're starting with a tiny school—forty families a year—because we believe mastering the factors critical to great, humane learning environments takes extreme focus. We hope that eventually, stories of our work—and the tools and materials we create—will help grow our collective imagination of what the future of learning could be.

        Now, we're looking to build a diverse, multi-disciplinary founding team devoted to deep relationships, deep ideas, and deep work. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Come join us. (Or at least drop us a line to hear about why you should.)
