# 2020 in review

This past March—when public safety required the shutdown of all, nonessential public life to slow the spread of the coronavirus—makes the previous one seem less existential.

In March 2019, the Somerville School Committee rejected our proposal to start a small, new high school after years of collaborative effort. It was a huge disappointment and a time for us to pause and reflect as an organization. We didn't know what was next, but we continued some of the work we'd been doing in preparation to launching the high school. We continued developing a Digital Literacy and Computer Science program with High Meadows Graduate School of Teaching and Learning, exploring new partnerships with local school districts, and spinning off some of our curricular ideas into a new project-based curriculum project with XQ Institute.

At the start of 2020, we were ready to reenter the public sphere as an organization, but the public sphere wasn't going to remain open for long. While the pandemic has hit the slo-mo or pause buttons on some of these plans, as it has so many things, we're still here, and we're still looking to invent the future of learning.

After the vote, we got a lot of questions about what was on the horizon for Powderhouse. At the time, we didn't know. Now, we've got some ideas, and we're excited to share them with you here. As you scroll through our year in review, you'll see pictures and videos from projects we've tackled, excerpts from reading and writing we've done, artifacts from collaborative design workshops and other playful reflections from the year. Without providing a manifesto or a clear through line, we hope that, taken together, it will give you a sense of where we've been and where we're headed.

Thanks for taking the time to look, and please get in touch with us@powderhouse.org if you'd like to connect about anything you see here.

Gratefully,

There has been a lot of movement this year at Powderhouse – literally and figuratively. From U-hauls, to great blog posts, to our own two feet, what's moved us in 2020 is sure to carry momentum into the new year.

## We moved abodes.

These stay-at-home times still brought a change of scenery for two of our teammates who moved in 2020.Alec discovered new heights on the other side of Winter Hill, and Rosalie found greener pastures across the Mystic River.

Fun fact: Shaunalynn and Alec have an unusually high aptitude for moving furniture into and out of precarious New England apartments, and more than once have considered opening their own moving company. Powderhouse Moving LLC?

## We moved our bodies

Although quarantine kept us inside homes old and new, we still found ways to get outside and moving.

## We were moved.

Our minds stretched, our spirits lifted, and our hearts expanded countless times this year, through the inspiring work of artists and thinkers we humbly admire. Here are some of our favorites excerpts from readings we came across this year.

# Reclaiming algebra

![Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/algebra-header.svg](Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/algebra-header.svg)

> The fact is that there is nothing as dreamy and poetic, nothing as radical, subversive, and psychedelic, as mathematics. It is every bit as mind blowing as cosmology or physics (mathematicians conceived of black holes long before astronomers actually found any), and allows more freedom of expression than poetry, art, or music (which depend heavily on properties of the physical universe). Mathematics is the purest of the arts, as well as the most misunderstood.

— Paul Lockhart, "A Mathematician's Lament"

This past year, as part of a project-based learning library we're developing with the XQ Institute, we've found ourselves thinking a lot about math, and algebra specifically. As we began this work, we found ourselves bringing many of our perspectives on computation to bear on math. Some of them fit, but not all. Specifically, we found that while many ideas about how you might go about learning something like computation or math are similar, why you'd go about them is quite different. We knew, in order to do good work in math, we needed to explore the why as well as the how.

[Algebra experiences](https://www.notion.so/71e8db5b5289457ebef41da763d18c03)

The first (and often only) why many people have for doing algebra is a requirement in school. And of the larger why of algebra—as in why algebra specifically—local legend Robert Moses, founder of The Algebra Project, addresses this.

> So algebra, once solely in place as the gatekeeper for higher math and the priesthood who gained access to it, now is the gatekeeper for citizenship; and people who don’t have it are like the people who couldn’t read and write in the industrial age. But because of how access to—the learning of—algebra was organized in the industrial era, its place in society under the old jurisdiction, it has become not [just] a barrier to college entrance, but a barrier to citizenship. It didn’t have to be algebra; that’s the decision the mathematical community made over the years. In France, geometry is the driving force of the math and technology education. So, there’s nothing that says that it has to be algebra. There’s nothing that says it has to be geometry. It could be a mix of a number of things—and some people would argue that it should be. There are educators and people who are driving math reform who want to make it a mix, but they’re dealing with teachers and parents who understand that geometry is one subject, and algebra is another. They don’t understand unified math. So I don’t think there will be cultural change around that anytime soon. For the time being, it’s going to be algebra.

— Robert Moses, *Radical Equations*

At the intersection of these many voices, finding some clarity about the why of algebra, we turned our attention to the what. What are we talking about when we talk about algebra, and what does it entail in most traditional contexts? To answer this question, we surveyed the contents of traditional algebra courses, working to understand the blurry lines between algebra and other areas of math in order to better understand its makeup and organization.

From this zoomed out perspective, starting to see the shape of algebra revealing itself when we squinted, we knew we needed to dive back into the details for things to come back into focus. As Seymour Papert said, "You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something."

And for us, with algebra, that "something" was Gelfand's Algebra. As we worked through this book, what stood out first was the pedagogical style of the narration. Teaching largely through problems and worked examples, the book scaffolds you in building your understanding from the ground up, doing problems first with numbers, then generalizing to do the same operations on variables, then adding new kinds of operations bit by bit. Sometimes an explanation comes before a problem, sometimes after, sometimes it is embedded in a given solution. Some problems are open-ended explorations of mathematical ideas while others are clearly exercises, aimed at developing your fluency with a given technique.

Gelfand's breakdown of algebra sparked an idea, that algebra is simply arithmetic applied to variables instead of numbers.

[The ideas of algebra](https://www.notion.so/c53db67cb9204f26a592d7598c1bb65a)

Gelfand isn't the only person to have had this idea—and one of our favorite, playful explorations of the parallel is actually in Vi Hart's How I Feel About Logarithms—but its implications for equity and access in algebra are exciting.

Specifically, this parallel between algebra and arithmetic suggests the possibility of rethinking how we conceive of being "ahead" or "behind" in algebra. If people with substantially different mathematical backgrounds can meaningfully engage the same kinds of material side-by-side, then you've got something that can actually work meaningfully for all students in an inclusive setting. Reminiscent of stories Moses tells in Radical Equations, our own story comes full circle, because even outside traditional settings, this ability for novices and experts to work side-by-side is one of the characteristics we care most about in the learning environments we design at Powderhouse.

This is what we want for math. The ideas are newer to us, but we're standing on the shoulders of giants and somehow coming back to the same, core ideas of model-making and constructionism with which we started this exploration.

![https://images.prismic.io/powderhs/07f19d99-a15a-471e-bb33-e9b23ebb7b8b_modeling-syllabi.jpeg](https://images.prismic.io/powderhs/07f19d99-a15a-471e-bb33-e9b23ebb7b8b_modeling-syllabi.jpeg)

A list of modeling topics, fading from top to bottom, including "Diffusion as a particle and as a grid," How high up would the bird need to be for its poop to kill Rosalie?" and "How much force does your foot feel when you're running?"

Toward the beginning of this year, we did an immersive workshop in which we did some quick and dirty, collaborative model-making of all different types. Some were based on in-progress projects. Some were based on experiences we had getting to work that day. Feel free to poke through our pre-readings, process documentation, and reflections to learn a little more about this exploration here.

As we reflect on our explorations of algebra over this past year, we are most struck by how little our explorations look and feel like math class. Not all math classes, for sure, but a lot of them at least. We can hardly do better than to end with Lockhart again, who said,

> I can hardly do better than to begin with G.H. Hardy’s excellent description:
"A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas."

— Paul Lockhart, "A Mathematician's Lament"

# Lines of inquiry

![Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/lines-of-inquiry-header.svg](Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/lines-of-inquiry-header.svg)

Because we believe people need better things to learn and that teachers must also be learners, members of our team have what we call a "line of inquiry."

A line of inquiry is ***something*—let's call it a thread—which you are investigating deeply through the projects, programs, and other work you create**.  It's kind of like a scientist's research agenda or an artist's artist statement or a journalist's beat.

The *something* could be a problem you're interested in solving.

It could be a question you're interested in answering.

It could be a phenomenon you want to understand some aspect of.

While Powderhouse is working toward its mission, we bring our individual passions, perspectives, and expertise to the organization by developing our lines of inquiry.

# Projects and prototypes

![Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/projects-header.svg](Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/projects-header.svg)

Projects are the bread and butter of work at Powderhouse. Whether we are prototyping a project for classroom environments, creating a gift for a loved one while learning a new tool, or making legible to an audience that which we find most meaningful, curious, or problematic in the world, projects are where great, authentic learning happens.

Many of the strengths and challenges with projects comes from their inherent messiness, uncertainty, and ambiguity. While at some level this mess is irreducible because authentic projects require tackling real work which can't be completely planned ahead of time, we strive to mitigate these risks by developing our own lightweight structures to support our messy, creative process. Our Production Roadmap paves the way for the life cycle of a project from the very first glimmer of an idea, to sharing the finished product with the world.

## Project phase descriptions

- Seed, pitch ⇒ Every project begins with the seed of an idea. It could be an inspiration you came across in a video, a personal passion you've had since childhood, or an activity you've always wanted to try. Oftentimes it is under-specified and under-defined. Some seeds get worked into a pitch, a lightweight artifact that paints the picture of what the project-doer hopes to do, how they'll know its good, and when they'll plan to finish it. We share and approve one another's pitches, keeping quality, scope, and alignment with organizational goals at the forefront.
- Production, editorial ⇒ In every creative field, whether writing or film, work undergoes an iterative editing and production process. Like in journalism, work passes from "structural" editing (in which big questions or issues like overall flow or argument are addressed) to "rough" editing (where overall structure is set, but you may, e.g., refine individual sections) to "line" or "copy" editing (where fine details of language, fact checking, and typographical errors are the focus). Analogously in film, work moves from "assembly" to "rough cut" to "final cut". Our editorial and production phases often happen in tandem, to support project doers to do their best work and bring a project to completion.
- Complete ⇒ Authentic projects have some function or purpose, often associated with a real audience or moment of deployment. Sometimes, this deployment is part of producing a project (e.g. in putting on a performance). Sometimes, the project is "done" and then demoed or exhibited. Inevitably, actually demoing and exhibiting is the final step towards completion, even as this phase continues to flush out many bugs, issues, and questions. It is impossible to catch all of these ahead of time, but oftentimes these are the most important issues to catch.
- Never, Later, Archive ⇒ Not every project survives. For some we hit the pause button until circumstances change, for others, we accept that their journey has come to end. We still chronicle and archive our paused and forgone work, and keep the lessons learned.

# Administrivia

![Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/administrivia-header.svg](Remaking%20the%20Annual%20Review,%20Redux%20542fb31bdbed48abb430ab129a065125/administrivia-header.svg)

This year has been a mix of administrative challenges and organizational maturing for Powderhouse.

Like many people—and organizations—we have struggled during COVID with remote work and, in our context, challenges working directly with youth. Overall, though, we've been incredibly lucky. The one administrative obstacle that colored our year, however, was being unable to work in our space, first because of what turned out to be a maze of red tape and then the further complications and delays of operating during COVID.

After nearly a year of dropping in at ISD in City Hall (pre-COVID), emailing, and calling—and with the help of City Councilors Katjana Ballantyne and Lance Davis (thank you both!)—we finally had the Stop Work order lifted and can return to our home-sweet-garage.

In addition to these challenges, there have also been a bunch of organizational firsts we wanted to take a moment to celebrate.

Circles have also made some prominent appearances in our creative work throughout 2020, though they are a little less of a surprise. They've been a motif in our work since before Powderhouse was Powderhouse, in large part because they are so rich with powerful ideas. Ideas about curvature and symmetry, about angle and rotation, about time and the infinite. Here are a few conceptual explorations of circle that captured our hearts and minds this year.

But our work hasn't all been about circles, some has itself been made up of circles. From optical illusions to geometric drawing machines to explorations of vectors and visual proof. Here is a collection of work we tackled this year that put circles at their center.

# Sounds

But we haven't just been seeing things. The sounds of the times are many. The number of construction projects across the city is huge. Cranes and jackhammers can often be heard from 7 in the morning until 10 at night. There are the sounds of backyard parties and delivery trucks and the woman down the street who started hosting Zumba classes in her backyard. These are the sounds of Somerville in 2020, along with a photo of the backyard where we sometimes tried to meet in person, yelling to be heard over the din of pandemic life.

The noise of city life aside, though, sound as a phenomenon has shown up even more frequently in our creative work this year. Perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise. Two of us are musicians and two of us dancers, plus the connections between music and math (the focus of a project we're working on with XQ) are well trodden territory. Still, from the logarithmic scale of pitch to the physics of speakers to the dance-based, musical pedagogy called Plastique Anime, sound's imprint on our work in 2020 can be heard loud and clear.

We thought we'd start this section literally. Since the pandemic shut the world down in March, we've been working from home (WFH). And like many people in this situation, our worlds have become smaller. Without a commute or social gatherings or travel, the diversity of people, places, and non-screen-based things we are seeing has shrunk. Rather than seeing each other, or our favorite peach-colored room in our space, this is what we actually saw most of the time we were "at work" this year. Here is what our WFH set-ups look like.

More than just the routine sites of our workspaces, however, we also found that sight, as a concept, showed up a surprising amount in our creative work this year. Ranging from the optics of light to the anatomy of the eye to the digital representation of graphics, this year included a pretty rich, collective exploration of sight, light, and visual representations.

# Meditations on our mission

After the school proposal was rejected, we carved out time to reconnect with our values, our strengths and our visions for the future of Powderhouse. Not every enterprise is afforded the opportunity to regroup and recommit from first principles, and we are grateful for the time to strengthen Powderhouse's sustainability and mission. To give you a sense of the headspaces we swam in, we've amassed a collection of meditations on a new mission, in our own words and in others', that inspire and propel us into a new season of Powderhouse Studios.
