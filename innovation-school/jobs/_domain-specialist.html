    As a domain specialist, you'll focus either on computation (building things with computers) or stortyelling. Every <em>two</em> cohorts of 30–40 people will have two domain specialists, one focused on computation, the other storytelling. Unlike the other members of Core Teams, you won't generally be designing full cohort programs.

    Your job is to design tools, materials, and experiences which make sure (1) everyone is fluent in your domain, and (2) the programs and projects people undertake are consistently grounded in the powerful ideas of that domain.

    You'll be:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…developing the depth of your colleagues’ and students’ capacities in your domain and creating materials and workflows which do the same.</li>
    <li>…working in small groups, providing one-on-one and one-on-few support as people work on their projects.</li>
    <li>…critiquing and refining program design to ensure domain depth and pedagogical quality to our interdisciplinary offerings.</li>
    <li>…constantly developing and finding new uses for your domain across others' projects and areas of interest.</li>
    <li>…and of course, developing your <a href="/faq/#what-is-this-program-of-study-you-keep-talking-about-staff-developing" class='link dim blue'>program of study</a> (which should be tied to your domain in some way).</li>
</ul>
<p class='list-intro'>
    This probably means you:
</p>
<ul class='list pl0'>
    <li>…have a background in building things with computers or telling stories (or a related discipline, e.g. mathematics or videography, respectively)</li>
    <li>…enjoy revisiting your domain to understand it more deeply and clearly</li>
    <li>…are excited about sharing your domain with others</li>
</ul>
