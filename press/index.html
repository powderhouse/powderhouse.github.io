        Doing things differently means other people talk about you. Here’s where you can find a few things people have said.

        PHS is a product of sprout &amp; co’s work over the past four years, with the support of hundreds of families, Somerville Public School staff, and experts from around the nation, to develop a world-class design under Massachusetts’ Innovation Schools legislation.

        In 2009, we began designing and running in- and afterschool programs with youth and evening programs with adults, working with partners ranging from the Cloud Foundation to Google to the Harvard Extension School. Historically, our programs have focused on making scientific investigation more of a cultural activity, something meaningful to people’s everyday.

        In 2012, Mayor Curtatone approached us about opening a new high school in Somerville under Massachusetts’s Innovation Schools Initiative, a piece of legislation which allows schools to have some of the same autonomies and flexibilities granted to Charter Schools while keeping money and oversight within the District.

        In 2013, our initial prospectus was unanimously approved by the Superintendent, chair of the School Committee, and president of the teachers’ union. This allowed us to convene an Innovation Planning Committee including parents, teachers, administrators, and other Somerville community members. They spent nearly a year reviewing and ultimately approving our Innovation Plan.

        In 2014, we were the first to seek (much less receive) relief from state statutes and regulations around school design under the Innovation Schools legislation. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education granted us relief from those regulations governing procurement and educator licensure.

        Beginning in late 2016, we’re excited to be joining the 7th and 8th grade team at the Healey School to develop interdisciplinary, project-based modules we hope will serve as a springboard for continued, project-based work at the Healey and our own enrollment outreach.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope to bring our final plan before the Somerville School Committee in early 2017—after we wrap up our negotiations with the Somerville Teachers Association—and open the following year as our campus is renovated. (We’ll be located at the older Powder House Community School building, which is being renovated over the next year into a fascinating, community campus with PHS at its center.)
