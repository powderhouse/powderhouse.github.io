<section class='overview'>
    <p>
        We’re working to build a diverse, tightly-knit, cross-functional team who loves learning and is devoted to building its future.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to work, learn, and invite young people to work and learn with us. This has led us to make something which looks more like a research lab or design studio than a school.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need help designing the tools, materials, and experiences which put doing and playing and exploring—around things which matter to you—at the center. And we need help designing an organization that does that—because we know it doesn’t look like school. This means we need founding staff eager to tackle open-ended design work with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re devoted to doing real work with young people, not to them or for them. That means we’re looking for people with an abiding interest or passion which they are eager to explore more deeply. We can help you connect young people to that passion, but we need you to bring the depth and love for a domain or practice—whether that be sculpting or computer programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re looking for outsiders, for people who not only see things differently, but also:
        <ul class='list'>
            <li>…like being around adolescents (and have an affection for adolescence)</li>
            <li>…are good at something (in addition to working with young people)</li>
            <li>…care about deep ideas</li>
            <li>…bring joy and playfulness to their explorations of those deep ideas</li>
            <li>…are good at diving into and learning new things</li>
            <li>…take pride in their ability to work and play well on a team</li>
            <li>…and can see themselves spending many years embedded in a community</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        People like this have many other options. We imagine you do, too. But there aren’t that many places you can do meaningful work like this. And there aren’t any places tackling these problems the way we are.
    </p>
    <p>
        In industry you can go buy or sell or process things (or ads to sell those things). If you’re lucky, you get to solve some interesting problems with talented people in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In academia, you can write a paper few will read. If you’re lucky, you can spend your time fundraising to hang out around beautiful ideas along with other interesting and talented people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, you can care for young people, work on deep projects and ideas, and invent the future of learning. We believe this is not only a once-in-a-lifetime experience, it is a lifetime experience. i.e. it’s work we’re devoted to for the rest of our lives. We believe this means we have to work sustainably and take care of ourselves, our families, and one another. A healthy approach to work and life is essential to us, which is why we offer very competitive salaries alongside flexible schedules and generous health, dental, and vision benefits. If you need flexibility or support in moving to Boston, we’ll work with you to make that happen, too. We’ll go to extremes for our team.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please stay away if you:
        <ul>
            <li>…are trying to “save” young people. Working with us isn’t a charitable act. But it is an ethical one: Right now, young people left behind by school pay the price for the rest of their lives. We think that’s wrong, and that it is school’s responsibility to fix.</li>
            <li>…want to “do some time” in school and then head off to do policy work or consulting or whatever it might be in three or four years. Moving on is fine, but this isn’t a pit stop.</li>
            <li>…think or talk about “what those kids need”—we know segregated water fountains are wrong; we believe segregated schools are, too.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Our team</h1>
    <p>
        We know world class work is done by small groups of great people, given the resources and freedom to run. We also know that great people want to work with great people. That means we build teams, person by person. We hope each team will work, learn, and stay together. If you join us, you will play a central role in hiring the rest of your team.
    </p>
    You can read a bit more about our current team here, or a little more about how we organize ourselves if you read on...

<section class='our-structure'>
    <h1>Our structure</h1>
    <div id='org-chart'>
        org-chart
    </div>
    <p>
        Three, core staff are responsible for managing the experience of each cohort of ~30 young people. Those three, core staff—in addition to whatever background they may bring—play the roles of a manager, a designer, and an advocate in the course of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class='position'>Manager</span> — Getting stuff done is hard. Whether building, programming, painting, or writing, people struggle to scope projects and manage their time. You are responsible for developing your team’s capacity and workflows to support the self and project management needs of your cohort. You don’t have to be an expert in everything, but you do have to be an expert in getting things done, and helping others to do the same.</li>
            <li><span class='position'>Designer</span> — Finding inspiration and turning that into a project is hard. You are responsible for developing your team’s capacity to develop rigorous programs and help young people uncover what inspires them. By designing seminars, collaborative projects, trips, and other investigations, you create contexts which speak to your cohort and help your team do the same.</li>
            <li><span class='position'>Advocate</span> — A finished project tells you nothing about the blood, sweat, and tears which went into it. Whether someone is struggling with depression or with parents going through a divorce, real life makes work harder. Your responsibility is to make sure non-academic realities are revealed and reflected in the work of your team, creating the social and emotional space for young people to grow through great work.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond these roles, we are also looking for four, targeted support staff who will float across two cohorts of young people. These support staff should bring with them a passion and fluency with numbers or words (or both) and a history of sharing that fluency with others. You will be floating between small groups, supporting people through individual tutoring and project mentorship as they tackle their work.
    </p>

<section id='our-vision'>
    <h1>Our vision</h1>
    <p>
        We believe the best way to predict the future of learning is to invent it. We believe learning is creative work, and schools should be joyous places which look and act more like design studios or research labs supporting people to pursue their interests. We believe this has only recently been made possible as many technologies have become accessible enough to allow young people to do rigorous, professional work across many domains.
    </p>
    <p>
        We draw much of our inspiration from the messy, playful ways in which creative work is actually done in the real world. Translating that inspiration into a workable reality calls for thoughtful prototyping and design work. That work needs to engage the regulatory, political, and economic realities which currently segregate and compromise school.
    </p>
    <p>
        This redesign requires autonomy, and Massachusetts’s Innovation Schools legislation has given us that autonomy while allowing us to stay in-district—just like any other public school. Whatever your feelings about charter schools—even at current enrollment growth rates—it would be more than a century before even 50% of young people enrolled. The future of learning will primarily be invented by districts. So, we’re going to where the young people are.
    </p>
    <p>
        But our long term vision isn’t just a school. PHS is our first step toward a research and design center inventing the future of learning. Prototyping that future requires actually working with young people. In a few years, we will begin working with both younger people—adding a year at a time until we are working with four and five year olds—and older, exploring postsecondary alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        All along the way, we will be developing the stories, tools, materials—and eventually policies—which we hope will dramatically expand what we imagine the future of learning to be.
    </p>
