<p>
	Projects are the bread and butter of work at Powderhouse. Whether we are
	prototyping a project for classroom environments, creating a gift for a
	loved one while learning a new tool, or making legible to an audience that
	which we find most meaningful, curious, or problematic in the world,
	projects are where great, authentic learning happens.
</p>
<p>
	Many of the strengths and challenges with projects comes from their inherent
	messiness, uncertainty, and ambiguity. While at some level this mess is
	irreducible because authentic projects require tackling real work which
	can’t be completely planned ahead of time, we strive to mitigate these risks
	by developing our own lightweight structures to support our messy, creative
	process. Our Production Roadmap paves the way for the life cycle of a
	project from the very first glimmer of an idea, to sharing the finished
	product with the world.

<h2 id="project-phase-descriptions">Project phase descriptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Seed, pitch ⇒ Every project begins with the seed of an idea. It could be
		an inspiration you came across in a video, a personal passion you’ve had
		since childhood, or an activity you’ve always wanted to try. Oftentimes
		it is under-specified and under-defined. Some seeds get worked into a
		pitch, a lightweight artifact that paints the picture of what the
		project-doer hopes to do, how they’ll know its good, and when they’ll
		plan to finish it. We share and approve one another’s pitches, keeping
		quality, scope, and alignment with organizational goals at the
		forefront.
	</li>
	<li>
		Production, editorial ⇒ In every creative field, whether writing or
		film, work undergoes an iterative editing and production process. Like
		in journalism, work passes from “structural” editing (in which big
		questions or issues like overall flow or argument are addressed) to
		“rough” editing (where overall structure is set, but you may, e.g.,
		refine individual sections) to “line” or “copy” editing (where fine
		details of language, fact checking, and typographical errors are the
		focus). Analogously in film, work moves from “assembly” to “rough cut”
		to “final cut”. Our editorial and production phases often happen in
		tandem, to support project doers to do their best work and bring a
		project to completion.
	</li>
	<li>
		Complete ⇒ Authentic projects have some function or purpose, often
		associated with a real audience or moment of deployment. Sometimes, this
		deployment is part of producing a project (e.g. in putting on a
		performance). Sometimes, the project is “done” and then demoed or
		exhibited. Inevitably, actually demoing and exhibiting is the final step
		towards completion, even as this phase continues to flush out many bugs,
		issues, and questions. It is impossible to catch all of these ahead of
		time, but oftentimes these are the most important issues to catch.
	</li>
	<li>
		Never, Later, Archive ⇒ Not every project survives. For some we hit the
		pause button until circumstances change, for others, we accept that
		their journey has come to end. We still chronicle and archive our paused
		and forgone work, and keep the lessons learned.
	</li>
