	There has been a lot of movement this year at Powderhouse – literally and
	figuratively. From U-hauls, to great blog posts, to our own two feet, what’s
	moved us in 2020 is sure to carry momentum into the new year.

	These stay-at-home times still brought a change of scenery for two of our
	teammates who moved in 2020.Alec discovered new heights on the other side of
	Winter Hill, and Rosalie found greener pastures across the Mystic River.

	Fun fact: Shaunalynn and Alec have an unusually high aptitude for moving
	furniture into and out of precarious New England apartments, and more than
	once have considered opening their own moving company. Powderhouse Moving
	LLC?

	Although quarantine kept us inside homes old and new, we still found ways to
	get outside and moving.

	Our minds stretched, our spirits lifted, and our hearts expanded countless
	times this year, through the inspiring work of artists and thinkers we
	humbly admire. Here are some of our favorites excerpts from readings we came
	across this year.
