	But we haven’t just been seeing things. The sounds of the times are many.
	The number of construction projects across the city is huge. Cranes and
	jackhammers can often be heard from 7 in the morning until 10 at night.
	There are the sounds of backyard parties and delivery trucks and the woman
	down the street who started hosting Zumba classes in her backyard. These are
	the sounds of Somerville in 2020, along with a photo of the backyard where
	we sometimes tried to meet in person, yelling to be heard over the din of
	pandemic life.

	The noise of city life aside, though, sound as a phenomenon has shown up
	even more frequently in our creative work this year. Perhaps it shouldn’t be
	a surprise. Two of us are musicians and two of us dancers, plus the
	connections between music and math (the focus of a project we’re working on
	with XQ) are well trodden territory. Still, from the logarithmic scale of
	pitch to the physics of speakers to the dance-based, musical pedagogy called
	Plastique Anime, sound’s imprint on our work in 2020 can be heard loud and
	clear.
