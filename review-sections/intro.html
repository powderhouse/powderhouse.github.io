	This past March—when public safety required the shutdown of all,
	nonessential public life to slow the spread of the coronavirus—makes the
	previous one seem less existential.
</p>
<p>
	In March 2019, the Somerville School Committee rejected our proposal to
	start a small, new high school after years of collaborative effort. It was a
	huge disappointment and a time for us to pause and reflect as an
	organization. We didn’t know what was next, but we continued some of the
	work we’d been doing in preparation to launching the high school. We
	continued developing a Digital Literacy and Computer Science program with
	High Meadows Graduate School of Teaching and Learning, exploring new
	partnerships with local school districts, and spinning off some of our
	curricular ideas into a new project-based curriculum project with XQ
	Institute.
</p>
<p>
	At the start of 2020, we were ready to reenter the public sphere as an
	organization, but the public sphere wasn’t going to remain open for long.
	While the pandemic has hit the slo-mo or pause buttons on some of these
	plans, as it has so many things, we’re still here, and we’re still looking
	to invent the future of learning.
</p>
<p>
	After the vote, we got a lot of questions about what was on the horizon for
	Powderhouse. At the time, we didn’t know. Now, we’ve got some ideas, and
	we’re excited to share them with you here. As you scroll through our year in
	review, you’ll see pictures and videos from projects we’ve tackled, excerpts
	from reading and writing we’ve done, artifacts from collaborative design
	workshops and other playful reflections from the year. Without providing a
	manifesto or a clear through line, we hope that, taken together, it will
	give you a sense of where we’ve been and where we’re headed.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks for taking the time to look, and please get in touch with
	us@powderhouse.org if you’d like to connect about anything you see here.
