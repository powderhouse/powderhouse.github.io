	This past year, as part of a project-based learning library we’re developing
	with the XQ Institute, we’ve found ourselves thinking a lot about math, and
	algebra specifically. As we began this work, we found ourselves bringing
	many of our perspectives on computation to bear on math. Some of them fit,
	but not all. Specifically, we found that while many ideas about how you
	might go about learning something like computation or math are similar, why
	you’d go about them is quite different. We knew, in order to do good work in
	math, we needed to explore the why as well as the how.

	The first (and often only) why many people have for doing algebra is a
	requirement in school. And of the larger why of algebra—as in why algebra
	specifically—local legend Robert Moses, founder of The Algebra Project,
	addresses this.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		So algebra, once solely in place as the gatekeeper for higher math and
		the priesthood who gained access to it, now is the gatekeeper for
		citizenship; and people who don’t have it are like the people who
		couldn’t read and write in the industrial age. But because of how access
		to—the learning of—algebra was organized in the industrial era, its
		place in society under the old jurisdiction, it has become not [just] a
		barrier to college entrance, but a barrier to citizenship. It didn’t
		have to be algebra; that’s the decision the mathematical community made
		over the years. In France, geometry is the driving force of the math and
		technology education. So, there’s nothing that says that it has to be
		algebra. There’s nothing that says it has to be geometry. It could be a
		mix of a number of things—and some people would argue that it should be.
		There are educators and people who are driving math reform who want to
		make it a mix, but they’re dealing with teachers and parents who
		understand that geometry is one subject, and algebra is another. They
		don’t understand unified math. So I don’t think there will be cultural
		change around that anytime soon. For the time being, it’s going to be
		algebra.
	</p>

<p>— Robert Moses, <em>Radical Equations</em></p>
<p>
	At the intersection of these many voices, finding some clarity about the why
	of algebra, we turned our attention to the what. What are we talking about
	when we talk about algebra, and what does it entail in most traditional
	contexts? To answer this question, we surveyed the contents of traditional
	algebra courses, working to understand the blurry lines between algebra and
	other areas of math in order to better understand its makeup and
	organization.
</p>
<p>
	From this zoomed out perspective, starting to see the shape of algebra
	revealing itself when we squinted, we knew we needed to dive back into the
	details for things to come back into focus. As Seymour Papert said, “You
	can’t think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something.”
</p>
<p>
	And for us, with algebra, that “something” was Gelfand’s Algebra. As we
	worked through this book, what stood out first was the pedagogical style of
	the narration. Teaching largely through problems and worked examples, the
	book scaffolds you in building your understanding from the ground up, doing
	problems first with numbers, then generalizing to do the same operations on
	variables, then adding new kinds of operations bit by bit. Sometimes an
	explanation comes before a problem, sometimes after, sometimes it is
	embedded in a given solution. Some problems are open-ended explorations of
	mathematical ideas while others are clearly exercises, aimed at developing
	your fluency with a given technique.
</p>
<p>
	Gelfand’s breakdown of algebra sparked an idea, that algebra is simply
	arithmetic applied to variables instead of numbers.

	>
</p>
<p>
	Gelfand isn’t the only person to have had this idea—and one of our favorite,
	playful explorations of the parallel is actually in Vi Hart’s How I Feel
	About Logarithms—but its implications for equity and access in algebra are
	exciting.
</p>
<p>
	Specifically, this parallel between algebra and arithmetic suggests the
	possibility of rethinking how we conceive of being “ahead” or “behind” in
	algebra. If people with substantially different mathematical backgrounds can
	meaningfully engage the same kinds of material side-by-side, then you’ve got
	something that can actually work meaningfully for all students in an
	inclusive setting. Reminiscent of stories Moses tells in Radical Equations,
	our own story comes full circle, because even outside traditional settings,
	this ability for novices and experts to work side-by-side is one of the
	characteristics we care most about in the learning environments we design at
	Powderhouse.
</p>
<p>
	This is what we want for math. The ideas are newer to us, but we’re standing
	on the shoulders of giants and somehow coming back to the same, core ideas
	of model-making and constructionism with which we started this exploration.

	A list of modeling topics, fading from top to bottom, including “Diffusion
	as a particle and as a grid,” How high up would the bird need to be for its
	poop to kill Rosalie?” and “How much force does your foot feel when you’re
	running?”
</p>
<p>
	Toward the beginning of this year, we did an immersive workshop in which we
	did some quick and dirty, collaborative model-making of all different types.
	Some were based on in-progress projects. Some were based on experiences we
	had getting to work that day. Feel free to poke through our pre-readings,
	process documentation, and reflections to learn a little more about this
	exploration here.
</p>
<p>
	As we reflect on our explorations of algebra over this past year, we are
	most struck by how little our explorations look and feel like math class.
	Not all math classes, for sure, but a lot of them at least. We can hardly do
	better than to end with Lockhart again, who said,
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		I can hardly do better than to begin with G.H. Hardy’s excellent
		description: “A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of
		patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because
		they are made with ideas.”
