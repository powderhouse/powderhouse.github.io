	Circles have also made some prominent appearances in our creative work
	throughout 2020, though they are a little less of a surprise. They’ve been a
	motif in our work since before Powderhouse was Powderhouse, in large part
	because they are so rich with powerful ideas. Ideas about curvature and
	symmetry, about angle and rotation, about time and the infinite. Here are a
	few conceptual explorations of circle that captured our hearts and minds
	this year.

	But our work hasn’t all been about circles, some has itself been made up of
	circles. From optical illusions to geometric drawing machines to
	explorations of vectors and visual proof. Here is a collection of work we
	tackled this year that put circles at their center.
