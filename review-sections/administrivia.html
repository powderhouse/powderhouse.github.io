	This year has been a mix of administrative challenges and organizational
	maturing for Powderhouse.
</p>
<p>
	Like many people—and organizations—we have struggled during COVID with
	remote work and, in our context, challenges working directly with youth.
	Overall, though, we’ve been incredibly lucky. The one administrative
	obstacle that colored our year, however, was being unable to work in our
	space, first because of what turned out to be a maze of red tape and then
	the further complications and delays of operating during COVID.
</p>
<p>
	After nearly a year of dropping in at ISD in City Hall (pre-COVID),
	emailing, and calling—and with the help of City Councilors Katjana
	Ballantyne and Lance Davis (thank you both!)—we finally had the Stop Work
	order lifted and can return to our home-sweet-garage.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to these challenges, there have also been a bunch of
	organizational firsts we wanted to take a moment to celebrate.
