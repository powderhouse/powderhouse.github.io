<p>
	After the school proposal was rejected, we carved out time to reconnect with
	our values, our strengths and our visions for the future of Powderhouse. Not
	every enterprise is afforded the opportunity to regroup and recommit from
	first principles, and we are grateful for the time to strengthen
	Powderhouse’s sustainability and mission. To give you a sense of the
	headspaces we swam in, we’ve amassed a collection of meditations on a new
	mission, in our own words and in others’, that inspire and propel us into a
	new season of Powderhouse Studios.
