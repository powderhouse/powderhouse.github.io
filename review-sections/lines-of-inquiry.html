	Because we believe people need better things to learn and that teachers must
	also be learners, members of our team have what we call a “line of inquiry.”
</p>
<p>
	A line of inquiry is
	<strong
		><em>something</em>—let’s call it a thread—which you are investigating
		deeply through the projects, programs, and other work you create</strong
	>. It’s kind of like a scientist’s research agenda or an artist’s artist
	statement or a journalist’s beat.
</p>
<p>The <em>something</em> could be a problem you’re interested in solving.</p>
<p>It could be a question you’re interested in answering.</p>
<p>It could be a phenomenon you want to understand some aspect of.</p>
<p>
	While Powderhouse is working toward its mission, we bring our individual
	passions, perspectives, and expertise to the organization by developing our
	lines of inquiry.
