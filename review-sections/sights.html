	We thought we’d start this section literally. Since the pandemic shut the
	world down in March, we’ve been working from home (WFH). And like many
	people in this situation, our worlds have become smaller. Without a commute
	or social gatherings or travel, the diversity of people, places, and
	non-screen-based things we are seeing has shrunk. Rather than seeing each
	other, or our favorite peach-colored room in our space, this is what we
	actually saw most of the time we were “at work” this year. Here is what our
	WFH set-ups look like.

	More than just the routine sites of our workspaces, however, we also found
	that sight, as a concept, showed up a surprising amount in our creative work
	this year. Ranging from the optics of light to the anatomy of the eye to the
	digital representation of graphics, this year included a pretty rich,
	collective exploration of sight, light, and visual representations.
